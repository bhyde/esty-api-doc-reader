Variations_PropertyQualifier

Overview[anchor]

A component of the larger Variations_PropertySet data structure, a property qualifier is a recursive data structure describing increasing specificity of a property. For example, for a listing in the Clothing: Pants category, the Size property is further qualified by the Recipient and Scale qualifying properties. A property qualifier describes these dependencies.

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
