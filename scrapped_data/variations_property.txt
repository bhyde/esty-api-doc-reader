Variations_Property

Overview[anchor]

Represents a property from a list of default or seller-defined properties to describe a variation of a listing. In addition to a default list including Size, Color, Finish, Dimensions and others, sellers may specify custom properties to more aptly describe their listings. When available, properties are returned as part of a Listing as the Variations association.

Although a Listing can be assigned any two properties from the list of available Variations properties, some properties and values are suggested for Listings in particular categories. The Variations_PropertySet resource can be used to access suggestions for a category.

Sellers are given their choice of two custom properties, which can be used for any purpose. When adding custom Variations, be sure to specify a map of property IDs and names using the custom_property_names field. NOTE: Using custom properties in place of predefined properties (Size, Color, Width, etc.) may be harmful to a Listing's search relevancy at a later date. Custom properties should only be used when no other property is suitable.

Optional qualifying properties should be specified when appropriate, and may be used in search at a later date. To determine the appropriate qualifiers and their values, see the Variations_PropertySet resource. (NOTE: If the recipient_id qualifier is specified here, it will overwrite the value of recipient on the Listing. When in doubt, the value appropriate to added Variations should be preferred.)

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
