ShippingTemplate

Overview[anchor]

Represents a template used to set a listing's shipping information.

ShippingTemplate, ShippingTemplateEntry, and ShippingInfo[anchor]

The diagram below is an ERD of the relevant portion of the database related to Listings.  Each Listing has a User,  and each User can have 0 or more ShippingTemplates.  We are enforcing that a user create at least one ShippingTemplate before creating a listing.   When that Listing is created the ShippingTemplate gets copied into the ShippingInfo table and is associated to that Listing.  You can then edit the ShippingInfo directly for a listing,  or update your ShippingTemplate and update the Listing with it.

  • A ShippingTemplate has a title and is owned by a user.
  • ShippingInfo is a set of records that define shipping information for a specific listing.  They are created from a ShippingTemplate.
  • ShippingTemplateEntries are a set of rows that correspond to this template.
      □ They hold an origin country,  and a destination, as well as the primary and secondary cost.
      □ There is only one origin per template,  so this is changed on the ShippingTemplate resource instead of the ShippingTemplateEntry. 
  • You can pass a destination id or a region id when creating a ShippingTemplateEntry, but not both - If you leave them both blank then the destination is assumed to be "everywhere"
  • If you create a  ShippingTemplateEntry with a region,  this implies several destinations and will insert a row for each destination within that region.
  • If you delete a ShippingTemplateEntry that is a region,  it will delete all corresponding destinations for that region.
  • You can update a ShippingTemplateEntry,  but because a region defines many rows, and different regions may have a different number of rows,  you cannot update the region.   You must first delete an entry corresponding to that region,  and then add an entry with the new region.
