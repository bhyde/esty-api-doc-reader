Listing

Overview[anchor]

Listings on Etsy are items for sale. Each Listing is associated with a User, and with a Shop (Users own Shops.) Etsy Listings have a creation date, and are valid for approximately four months. Listings have a price and a quantity, and when they're sold out, the User must renew them before they can be sold again.

Listing States[anchor]

The state field of Listings indicates whether a Listing is currently available for display on Etsy. Most of the time, you will only see Listings in the "active" state, but the following states may rarely appear:

   State     Can Edit Can Renew                                                                                                                                                                     Meaning
active       Yes      Yes       The Listing is currently for sale.
removed      No       No        The Listing has been removed by its owner.
sold_out     Yes*     Yes       The Listing has sold out. *Sold out listings can be edited, but active=true will only be honored if renew=true is aso passed. Users will be billed for this action. Otherwise, the listing will remain in the expired state. Note that when editing a sold out listing, you will need to update the quantity to a value greater than zero.
expired      Yes**    Yes       The Listing has expired. **Expired listings can be edited, but active=true will only be honored if renew=true is also passed. Users will be billed for this action. Otherwise, the listing will remain in the expired state.
alchemy      No       No        Deprecated; please ignore.
edit         No       No        The Listing is inactive. (For legacy reasons, this displays as "edit".)
draft        No       No        Draft listings are listings that have been saved prior to their first activation. The API can create draft listings, and also make draft listings active, but note that a listing in any other state cannot be moved to draft, nor can a draft listing be moved to any state other than active.
create       No       No        Deprecated. The Listing is currently being edited by the owner (as part of the initial Listing creation.)
private      No       No        The owner of the Listing has requested that it not appear in API results.
unavailable  No       No        The Listing has been removed by Etsy admin for unspecified reasons.

Searching Listings[anchor]

By default, the method findAllListingActive returns all active Listings on Etsy, paginated by date. Use the optional parameters (such as keyword, min_price, etc.) to narrow these results. The sort_order and sort_on parameters can be used to change the order of returned results. Note that these parameters are only available when using sort options. Without sort options, they will be ignored (and Listings will be returned newest-first.)

To search within a shop, use findAllShopListingsActive.

Editing Listings and Bill Charges[anchor]

Listings may be edited with the updateListing method. Note that the Etsy API will attempt to activate a Listing after every edit operation. This may result in charges to the user's Etsy bill. To edit an inactive Listing without activating it, pass the optional parameter state=inactive. Note that edit options that increase the quantity of a Listing will result in charges to the owner. It is the developer's responsibility to warn the user that such charges may occur.

To renew a Listing for another four months, pass the optional parameter renew=true. A Listing does not need to be expired to be renewed, however note that each renewal does not take the Listing's previous expiration date into account, so any unused time remaining on the Listing's old expiration date will be lost. Renewals will result in charges to a user's bill.

Translations[anchor]

Data of some models in the API can be expressed in multiple languages. For example, a Listing's title and description can be translated into German or French. To access this data in the API you can use the language parameter. Like this /listings/12345?language=de. For more information about this look at Working with Translations.

Categories and Tags[anchor]

Categories are no longer the first three tags of a Listing. Category is a first-class resource, with its own primary key ID. When calling createListing, you must pass a category_id to specify the category for the Listing.

Marketplace Attributes[anchor]

The fields who_made, when_made and is_supply are the so-called Marketplace Attributes that help buyers locate a Listing under the headings Handmade, Vintage and Supplies. When creating new Listings, these parameters are required. As of this writing, not all Listings on Etsy have their Marketplace Attributes set. These Listings will return null in these fields.
