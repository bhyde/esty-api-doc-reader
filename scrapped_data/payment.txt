payment_id          private          transactions_r   int    The payment's numeric ID.
buyer_user_id       private          transactions_r   int    The buyer's numeric ID.
shop_id             private          transactions_r   int    The shop's numeric ID.
receipt_id          private          transactions_r   int    The receipt's numeric ID.
amount_gross        private          transactions_r   int    The original gross amount of the order, in pennies - this is grand total, including shipping and taxes.
amount_fees         private          transactions_r   int    The original card processing fee of the order in pennies.
amount_net          private          transactions_r   int    The total value of the payment less fees (amount_gross - amount_fees).
posted_gross        private          transactions_r   int    The gross amount which posted to the ledger once shipped. This is equal to the amount_gross UNLESS the seller issues a refund prior to shipping. We consider "shipping" to the event which "posts" to the ledger. Therefore, if the seller refunds first, we simply reduce the amount_gross and post that amount. The seller never sees the refunded amount in their ledger. This is equal to the "Credit" amount in the ledger entry.
posted_fees         private          transactions_r   int    Amount of the fees that posted when shipped. We refund a proportional amount of the fees when a seller refunds a buyer. If they refund prior to shipping, the posted amount will be less then the original.
posted_net          private          transactions_r   int    The total value of the payment at the time of posting it to the ledger less fees (posted_gross - posted_fees)
adjusted_gross      private          transactions_r   int    If the payment is refunded, partially or fully, this is the new gross amount after the refund.
adjusted_fees       private          transactions_r   int    If the payment is refunded, partially or fully, this is the new fee amount after the refund.
adjusted_net        private          transactions_r   int    The total value of the payment after refunds less fees (adjusted_gross - adjusted_fees).
currency            private          transactions_r   string What currency the payment was made in.
shipping_user_id    private          transactions_r   int    The numeric id of the user to which the order is being shipped.
shipping_address_id private          transactions_r   int    The numeric id identifying the shipping address.
billing_address_id  private          transactions_r   int    The numeric id identifying the billing address of the buyer.
status              private          transactions_r   string Most commonly "settled" or "authed". Marks the current status of the payment.
shipped_date        private          transactions_r   int    The date and time the payment was shipped in Epoch seconds.
