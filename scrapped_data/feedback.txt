Feedback

Overview[anchor]

Etsy allows buyers and sellers to leave feedback for one another about a specific transaction. Each feedback record contains a short message from the buyer or seller, a value of -1, 0 or 1, and information about the item that was purchased.

Each feedback record has a buyer, a seller, an author, and a subject. Because feedback is a two-way process, each transaction on Etsy can have up to two feedback records, one left by a buyer in reference to a seller, and one left by a seller in reference to a buyer. To determine the context of a feedback record, you will neeed to examine both the creator_user_id and seller_user_id fields to determine whether the author of the feedback was the buyer or the seller in the transaction.

Feedback and Privacy Settings[anchor]

As of March 14, 2011, all purchases on Etsy are hidden from public areas. This has a direct effect on how feedback records are displayed in the API, since they contain information about a member's purchases. Certain fields of feedback records are now treated as private--this means that they can only been seen using the private API, with either the buyer or seller's OAuth credentials. If these conditions are not met, the fields will be missing from feedback responses.

The context of the API request (whether you are requesting the buyer's or the seller's feedback) has an impact on which fields are considered private. In a nutshell:

  • When querying a buyer's feedback, the seller's identity and the purchased listing will be private.
  • When querying a seller's feedback, the buyer's identity will be private.

The following table gives detailed information on which feeds will be private in various contexts. "Feedback Author" refers to the member who left the feedback (either the buyer, or the seller). "Viewing Context" refers to the member whose user ID was used to query the feedback (whether we are viewing feedback for the seller, or for the buyer).
