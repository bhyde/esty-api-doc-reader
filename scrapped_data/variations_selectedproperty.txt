Variations_SelectedProperty

Overview[anchor]

A data structure representing a buyer's selected variation for a listing. Returned as a collection as a property on CartListing and Transaction.

When in the context of a CartListing, special attention should be paid to the is_valid property. This will be false in the event that the variation has been changed or removed since the listing was added to the cart. Additionally, the purchase_state property of the parent CartListing will have a value of edited to signal this state. In this case the listing needs to be removed and re-added to the cart with a valid variation.

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
