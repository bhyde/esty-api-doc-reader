Variations_PropertySetProperty

Overview[anchor]

Represents a suggested Variations property as part of a set of suggested properties and options, dependent on one or more qualifiers (size scale, recipient, etc.) For more information, see Variations_PropertySet.

Although Etsy listings can contain any value for any available property, it's recommended to use these suggested properties whenever possible. They may be integrated into Etsy search at a later date.

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
