GuestCart

Overview[anchor]

Represents a guest shopping cart on Etsy. Users have one cart per shop.

This is a cart that is not yet associated to a single user, but to a guest ID for tracking purposes. Some important things to note about Guest Carts:

  • Each GuestID generated is associated only with the application that generated it. You may not access a guest's carts from multiple different applications.
  • Although Guest Carts do not require an authenticated user, they do require your app to have production access in order to be interacted with. Please use the sandbox to test your app and apply for production access when you've got an application ready for public use.
  • Guest Carts expire after 30 days of inactivity. Do not rely on a guest cart existing permanently, as they will be emptied and reset after those 30 days.
