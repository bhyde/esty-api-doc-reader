Variations_PropertySetOptionModifier

Overview[anchor]

Represents rules for display of Variations property options on Etsy, dependent on one or more qualifiers (size scale, recipient, etc.) The resource specified text that should come before and after the option.

When accessing existing Variations_Option records on Etsy listings, the field formatted_value will already have these display rules applied. This resource is only useful when adding new Variation options to listings, in order to preview the options as they will appear once saved.

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
