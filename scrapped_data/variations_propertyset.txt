Overview[anchor]

When managing variations of a listing, a property set is a data structure that defines how a property is specified for a given category. For instance, the Size property requires varying degrees of specificity when describing Clothing: Pants as opposed to Jewelery: Rings; the additional specificity allows us to suggest more appropriate options — e.g. men’s UK pant sizes — for a given property. Properties and Property Sets describes in further detail how to interpret this data.

NOTE: Support for Listing Variations is a beta feature. For full documentation on working with Listing Variations, see Working with Variations.
